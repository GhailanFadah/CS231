# CS231 Sudoku Solver

A program that solves a given Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. Has the ability to create its own random board if one is not passed in.

This program was developed durning my sophomore year at Colby college in my data structures and algorithms course. The main data structure implemented durning this program is a stack where I used a backtracking algorithm inorder to solve the board one space at a time. In order to use the program one can either pass in a 9X9 board with zeros for blanks and a number between 1-9 otherwise or let the program develop its own random board based on passed in conditions.

outside the scope of the project, I added some color enhancements as well as an automation class to run large sets of trials to collect data.
