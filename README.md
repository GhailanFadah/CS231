# CS231 Sudoku Solver

A program that solves a given Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. Has the ability to create its own random board if one is not passed in.

This program was developed durning my sophomore year at Colby college in my data structures and algorithms course. The main data structure implemented durning this program is a stack where I used a backtracking algorithm inorder to solve the board one space at a time.
